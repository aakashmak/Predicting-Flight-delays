# Predicting-Flight-delays

Introduction

In the dynamic world of airline operations, efficiency and punctuality stand as pillars of service excellence. With a dataset encompassing a broad spectrum of flight information over various time frames, our project delves into the operational nuances during peak and off-peak seasons specifically comparing the bustling December holidays against the calmer month of April. Our primary goal is to unveil patterns and correlations that could inform and improve airline strategies, leading to enhanced service quality and operational efficiency.
 
This exploration seeks to answer pivotal questions: How do different airlines manage their schedules and resources during high and low travel seasons? What are the typical challenges they face, and how could these be mitigated? To address these inquiries, we employ a series of analytical methods, including logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), and multi-linear regression, each chosen for its ability to elucidate specific facets of flight delay and cancellation data.

Through this analysis, we aim to provide stakeholders with valuable insights that not only reflect operational challenges but also spotlight opportunities for enhancing passenger satisfaction and optimizing overall airline performance. By comparing data from December and April, we anticipate uncovering significant operational insights that could lead to more robust and responsive airline services
