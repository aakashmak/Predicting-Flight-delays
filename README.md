# Predicting-Flight-delays

Introduction

In the dynamic world of airline operations, efficiency and punctuality stand as pillars of service excellence. With a dataset encompassing a broad spectrum of flight information over various time frames, our project delves into the operational nuances during peak and off-peak seasons specifically comparing the bustling December holidays against the calmer month of April. Our primary goal is to unveil patterns and correlations that could inform and improve airline strategies, leading to enhanced service quality and operational efficiency.
 
This exploration seeks to answer pivotal questions: How do different airlines manage their schedules and resources during high and low travel seasons? What are the typical challenges they face, and how could these be mitigated? To address these inquiries, we employ a series of analytical methods, including logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), and multi-linear regression, each chosen for its ability to elucidate specific facets of flight delay and cancellation data.

Through this analysis, we aim to provide stakeholders with valuable insights that not only reflect operational challenges but also spotlight opportunities for enhancing passenger satisfaction and optimizing overall airline performance. By comparing data from December and April, we anticipate uncovering significant operational insights that could lead to more robust and responsive airline services

#  EXPLORATORYDATAANALYSIS
1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration
 
 ● The initial step in our analysis involved loading the flight dataset to examine the structure
 and types of data available.
 
 ● This provided an overview of the various fields, helping identify which columns contain
 categorical data, numerical data, and potential identifiers for airlines and time metrics.
 
2. Data Filtering
 
 ● Our analysis focused specifically on flight data from December, a significant month due
 to holiday travel, which may influence patterns in delays and flight cancellations.
 
 ● Thissubset helps us concentrate on seasonal effects on flight performance.
 
3. Data Cleaning
 
 ● Tostreamline our analysis, we removed several columns that were not necessary for our
 primary objective, which focuses on flight delays.
 
 ● This step simplified the dataset, reducing the dimensionality and focusing on the most
 impactful variables such as departure delays and airline identifiers.
 
4. Handling Missing Values
 
 ● We assessed and quantified missing values across the dataset to ensure the integrity of
 our analysis.
 
 ● By calculating the percentage of completeness per column, we identified fields with
 significant missing data, which were then excluded from further analysis to maintain the
 robustness of our findings.
 
 ● This process involved removing any records that still contained missing values after our
 initial column filtering.

5. Linking Airlines with Names
 
 ● For clarity and ease of interpretation, we integrated an external dataset that provided
 mappings from airline IATA codes to full airline names.
 
 ● This enhancement was crucial for presenting our findings in a more understandable
 format, replacing obscure codes with recognizable airline names.

6. Statistical Analysis
 
 ● The core of our exploratory analysis involved calculating basic statistical measures for
 departure delays across different airlines.
 
 ● We computed the count, mean, minimum, and maximum delays to identify trends and
 outliers in airline performance.
 
 ● This analysis helped in understanding which airlines had the most significant issues with
 delays and which performed well, even during the busy travel season
